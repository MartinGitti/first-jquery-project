<p>
  First look at JQuery.<br/>
  JavaScript library that allows you to do more with less code. In this this project, I use JQuery to add some basic animation to my html page.

### View of Web Page:
<img src="/Images/jquery.gif" alt="view of web page">
<hr/>

### Use of code:
<p>Please feel free to use the code of the projects above.</p>
<p>I've made use of a text editor to put all of my code together and used Google Chrome as my default browser to view my Web Pages.</p>
<p>In order to edit the code, I'd suggest using a Text Editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.</p>
